**Enhanced SD-CWT PoC**

This repository contains experimental code for creating something along the lines of SD-CWT while using CSF (Embedded Signatures) instead of COSE.

On https://cyberphone.github.io/sd-experimental/doc/ you will find the documentation.

The code is complete (with respect to issuance), including verification of issuer signature and disclosures.
